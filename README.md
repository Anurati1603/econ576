# Automated House Price Prediction System
We automated the process of predicting house prices using linear regression and advanced machine learning techniques. Our system handled data preprocessing tasks such as managing categorical variables, filling missing values, and creating dummy variables. We split the data into training and testing sets, trained a linear regression model, and evaluated its performance. Additionally, we explored more sophisticated models like Lasso regression and XGBoost by conducting hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. To further enhance accuracy, we employed XGBoost, a powerful machine learning technique. Through an exhaustive hyperparameter search using GridSearchCV, we identified the optimal parameters for the XGBoost regressor. Subsequently, we trained the XGBoost model on both the training dataset and the entire dataset using the best parameters obtained. Finally, we made predictions on an unseen test/validation set and generated a submission file in Excel format for evaluation.
